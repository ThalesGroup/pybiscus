# Robust aggregation against malicious clients

The strategies of the `flowergeneric` plugin include aggregations meant to resist malicious
(byzantine) clients: `fedmedian`, `fedtrimmedavg` (`beta`: fraction trimmed on each side), `krum`
(`num_malicious_clients` f, `num_clients_to_keep` > 0 for Multi-Krum) and `bulyan`
(`num_malicious_clients` f; needs at least 4f + 3 clients, which `server check` enforces on
`min_fit_clients`: below, Flower fails in the middle of the aggregation).

## Testing them: the `byzantine` client

`pybiscus-plugins/client/byzantine` is a client that trains honestly, then alters its update
delta = w_trained − w_global before sending it:

| `attack` | sent | |
|---|---|---|
| `sign_flip` (`scale`) | w_global − scale · delta | pulls the model the wrong way |
| `scale` (`scale`) | w_global + scale · delta | dominates the aggregate |
| `gaussian` (`stddev`) | w_global + noise | a faulty client |
| `none` | the honest update | with `num_examples_factor`, lies about its size only |

`from_round` delays the attack, `seed` fixes the noise; the client reports a `byzantine` metric.
It is a test tool: it is declared in `launch/campaign/test-plugins-conf.yml` only, never in the
default manifest, so that it does not appear in a real session's forms. A client uses it through
`flower_client.alternate_client_class: {name: byzantine, config: {...}}`, with the test manifest
added: `PYBISCUS_PLUGIN_CONF_PATH=pybiscus-plugins-conf.yml:launch/campaign/test-plugins-conf.yml`.

The campaign tool takes the extra manifests (`plugin_manifests`) and per-client settings for a
variant (`client_overrides`, by client number):

```bash
uv run python launch/campaign/strategy_campaign.py launch/campaign/cifar10_robust.yml
```

## Results (cifar10, 7 clients, iid shares, 3 local epochs, 5 rounds)

Test accuracy at round 5; attackers flip the sign of their update and scale it by 10.

| strategy | no attacker | 1 attacker | 2 attackers |
|---|---|---|---|
| FedAvg | 0.406 | 0.110 (collapsed) | 0.112 (collapsed) |
| FedMedian | 0.417 | 0.332 | 0.276 |
| FedTrimmedAvg, beta 0.2 | 0.354 | 0.380 | 0.099 (collapsed) |
| Krum, f 1 | 0.385 | 0.363 | 0.362 |
| Multi-Krum, f 1, keep 3 | 0.384 | 0.386 | 0.388 |
| Bulyan, f 1 | 0.391 | 0.364 | 0.387 |

- One attacker out of seven is enough to break FedAvg for the whole run.
- Beta 0.2 trims one client on each side out of seven: the second attacker stays in the mean.
- Krum, Multi-Krum and Bulyan resist two attackers although set for one: these attackers do not
  collude, and each lands far from the honest clients. Colluding attackers that stay close to
  them (smaller, coordinated changes) are the case these guarantees are about; not tested yet.
- Without attacker, the robust aggregations cost little on iid shares (single runs, differences of
  the order of the run-to-run noise).
- A client reporting 20 times its examples with an honest update barely changes FedAvg
  (0.373): the lie is harmful combined with a malicious update, not alone.

## Heterogeneous shares (dirichlet 0.5)

Same setting, each client dominated by a few classes (2 834 to 9 930 images): honest clients look
different from one another, and a robust aggregation may discard them as outliers
(`launch/campaign/cifar10_robust_dirichlet.yml`).

| strategy | no attacker | 1 attacker |
|---|---|---|
| FedAvg | 0.398 | 0.102 (collapsed) |
| FedMedian | 0.366 | 0.278 |
| FedTrimmedAvg, beta 0.2 | 0.355 | 0.285 |
| Krum, f 1 | 0.281 | 0.275 |
| Multi-Krum, f 1, keep 3 | 0.292 | 0.328 |
| Bulyan, f 1 | 0.333 | 0.348 |

- Without attacker, the robust aggregations now cost 3 to 12 points: Krum, which keeps a single
  client, loses the most (0.281 against 0.398), Bulyan the least of the Krum family.
- Against one attacker, the median and the trimmed mean hold less well than on iid shares (about
  0.28 against 0.33 to 0.38): the honest spread hides the attacker less clearly.
- Bulyan offers the best balance here. Single runs: differences of a few points are within the
  run-to-run noise.
